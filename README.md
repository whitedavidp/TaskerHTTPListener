# TaskerHTTPListener

Receive HTTP requests in Tasker.

## Changes from [original](https://github.com/Admicos/TaskerHTTPServer)

* Lowered minimum-SDK to 16 to permit running on JellyBean (which I needed).
* Updated to reference later version of Tasker Plugin API
* Optionally receive HTTPS requests in Tasker using a simple, self-signed certificate found in the assets folder. Slight modification to the UI to support this.
* Changed the name from Server to Listener as that really better describes what this app does as it really does not "serve" anything to the client.

## Downloads

* Hope to get this ready for and uploaded to Play Store in an official release sometime in the future.
